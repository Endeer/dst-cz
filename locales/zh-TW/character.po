When fate put William in possession of the Codex Umbra, he felt true power for the first time in his life. Casting off his old, meek ways and fully embracing his new persona as a charismatic master of dark magic, Maxwell achieved fame and success, but still found himself hungering for more. As he delved deeper and deeper into his magical tome, immersing himself in its secrets, the dark knowledge within addled his mind and clouded his heart. In his final performance, Maxwell lost control of the shadow magic he'd used so brazenly and both he and his stage assistant Charlie were pulled into the Constant. There he would remain for what seemed like an eternity, tethered to the Nightmare Throne and compelled to ensnare more victims in the Constant's trap.\nHe is still baffled by the thought that someone he tricked into the Constant could find it in their heart to set him free... well, baffled and annoyed really.

At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again.\nWell, at least not in this world."
msgstr "深夜，威爾遜正在家中的實驗室忙活，突然聽到收音機裡有一個聲音直接跟他說話。他嚇了一跳：起初，他擔心自己因為熬太多夜或是不小心吸入了化學煙霧而發瘋了。但這個聲音向他保證，這並不是他的臆想。不但如此，這個聲音還給他提了個建議：如果威爾遜按照他們的規格製造出一台機器，那麼他將獲得秘密知識的獎勵——這種秘密知識是沒有人見過的。他有點鬼迷心竅了（畢竟，與一個神秘的聲音做一個模糊的交易又有什麼壞處呢？）威爾遜全身心地投入到了機器的建造中。當它終於完成時，這位紳士科學家遲疑了一下……如果他當時意志力再強一點，可能就會把他從即將到來的厄運中拯救出來了。但在那聲音的堅持下，威爾遜還是按下開關，啟動了他的發明……然後他就再也沒有出現過了。\n至少在這個世界裡再也沒有。"

When her younger sister Charlie disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Winona refused to let the case grow cold and dedicated herself to finding her. For over a decade she tracked down every clue, followed every lead, poked, prodded, and questioned anyone who might have a connection to the case, until all the loose strings started to come together. There was a radio factory, founded by a peculiar old man whose genius was only matched by his secretiveness, that might hold the answers she had sought for so long. Shortly after securing employment at the factory, the building was destroyed in an accident caused by a malfunctioning portal. Having caught sight of someone getting caught in the portal and vanishing, Winona hastily repaired it in the hopes of rescuing them, only to come face to face with her missing sister. Unfortunately, Charlie seemed to be held under the sway of a shadowy influence, and she dragged Winona into the Constant."

His quest would lead him across Europe and eventually even across the Atlantic to America, where his feats of muscular prowess caught the attention of Misters Abernethy & Parker, who invited him to headline in their newly-formed traveling circus. Wolfgang quickly found himself caught up in the pageantry of circus life, and his attention began to shift to finding ways to make his show more spectacular. Fearing his own strength wouldn't be enough to keep impressing the crowds, he started employing a bit of stage trickery, with each new act becoming more unbelievable than the last. As his act grew more outlandish, the risk of being exposed as a fraud grew, and as he suffered one embarrassing mistake after another his once unshakable confidence in his abilities was slowly chipped away.\nUntil one day, a chance encounter gave him a taste of the ultimate strength he had craved for so long..."
